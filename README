jcampfire: Basic Campfire API in Java, for 37signals' Campfire business group chat.
(http://www.campfirenow.com)

It's not as full-featured as Tinder, but it's a good step towards getting 
Campfire output capability in Java.

This library was originally written by Jean-Philippe Daigle [jpdaigle@gmail.com] 
and is released under the WTFPL [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL].

The latest source can be downloaded from:

BUILD AND INSTALL JCAMPFIRE
===========================
Building:
$ ant clean build

Outputs:
_dist/jcampfire.jar		(The library only)
_dist/jcampfire.tar.gz	(API jar + Javadocs package)



ANT TASK
========
JCampfire includes an Ant task for echoing text from an Ant build to a Campfire room.
(In fact, this was the impetus for writing the library.)

To use it, put jcampfire.jar somewhere where Ant can reach and do this:

	<project name="jcampfire-ant-test">
		<taskdef 
			name="jcampfire" 
			classname="ca.softwareengineering.jcampfire.ant.JCampfireEcho" 
			classpath="_dist/jcampfire.jar"/>
		<target name="test">
			<jcampfire 
				user="ant@example.com" 
				password="mypassword" 
				subdomain="jcampfire" 
				room="Room 1" 
				failonerror="false"
				paste="false"
				message="Hello from ant" />
		</target>	
	</project>

Available attributes:
user		Email address to use for login
password	Password
subdomain	Campfire subdomain, without 'campfirenow.com' (SUBDOMAIN.campfirenow.com)
room		Name of room to join
message		Message to send to Campfire
paste		Whether to mark as paste (optional, default=false)
failonerror	Whether to fail the build on error (optional, default=true)



EXECUTABLE JAR
==============
In addition to the programmatic interface, jcampfire.jar can be used as an executable 
to post a Campfire message.

$ java -jar jcampfire.jar 



USING THE API (SAMPLE CODE)
===========================
	try {
		CampfireSession cs = new CampfireSession("subdomain", "user@example.com", "password");
		cs.connect();
		List<CampfireRoom> rooms = cs.getRooms(); // See all rooms
		System.out.println(rooms);
		CampfireRoom room1 = cs.getRoomByName("Room 1");
		room1.enter();
		room1.echo("Hello World", false);		
	} catch (CampfireException c_ex) {
		c_ex.printStackTrace();
	}
